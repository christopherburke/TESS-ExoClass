Added several checks for Tier ranking.
-PDC goodness Noise metri is now checked.  Sometimes PDC adds noise.  In this case Set flag.  This can sometimes get tripped if the star has intrinsic
   noise.
-Odd/Even depth difference must be higher Significance >4 if SNR>30.
   previous was 2.8 for all SNR, now if is 2.8 for SNR<30
-Planet radius estimate needs to be <20 Rearth to stay in Tier1
-Has secondary override for possible planet induced seconcary (albedo<1) is now moved to Tier 2.
