Multi-Sector 1-3 TEC run notes during spot checks
This is the first code base that supports generating difference image
and information for a multi-sector run.  Since it took so much time to develop the code to support multi-sector I didn't have time to look into the results this time.  I am still unhappy with the ability to generate difference images, which are supposed to identify which pixels contribute to the transit signal.  The difference images look odd for strong signals (maybe saturation effects) and disappear into noise altogether for lower snr signals.  Added another more basic difference image method, which is just average depth based on the cadences that that trapezoid model are with 0.5 of the max depth.  This is calculated after using the standard TEC detrending routine on each pixel.
